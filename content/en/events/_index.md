Select speakers from the [2022 Blockchain in Education Summit](https://summit.immersiveeducation.org/agenda.html) held in Lucerne, Switzerland, last year will be joined by Digital Civilisation speakers and international experts in the field of blockchain technology for a new 3-day series of public talks and workshops at University of Oxford focused on the impact of blockchain technology on education and our global society.

Topics to be addressed at Oxford include: 1) Publishing and protecting student (learner) data on public blockchains, 2) Scaling to handle "millions to billions" of learners, 3) Learner authentication and anti-fraud measures using blockchain platforms, 4) Backup and recovery of critical blockchain data and contents, 5) Blockchain data analytics and visualization, and other topics related to utilizing blockchain technology in the fields of education, teaching, and training, 6) Designing blockchain platforms and applications, and 7) Digital civilisation in the context of open-source software.

The prestigious academic and technical conferences are open to the public:

SPEAKERS: Speakers, researchers, teachers, trainers, students, exhibitors, sponsors and other individuals interested in speaking, presenting or exhibiting at the conference are invited to review previous [Blockchain in Education Summit](https://summit.immersiveeducation.org/) and Digital Civilisation events and then sign up for the forthcoming Call for Participation (CFP).

## Past Events

{{< details "PAVe Trust Workshop 2022 | December 5th - December 9th | ACSAC Austin, Texas, USA" >}}
**The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)**

ACSAC, held at the AT&T Conference Center in Austin, Texas, brings together cutting-edge researchers, with a broad cross-section of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest security results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technology.

Committable will be introduced at ACSAC during The Blockhouse Technology Limited second sponsored workshop, Program Analysis and Verification on Trusted Platforms (PAVeTrust).

**Committable’s Workshop Program Introduction**

9:00-10:00 Invited talk 1: "Committable: OSS monetisation via trusted software analysis" by Liu Han (The Blockhouse Technology Limited, UK — Remote presentation) 

**Abstract**: "Committable is a decentralised protocol aimed at establishing a sustainable open-source ecosystem. The core design of the protocol is to allow developers to permissionlessly monetise an open-source software with a sequence of commits they contributed. The monetisation is algorithmic and realised through trusted software analysis which runs software analysis algorithms in trusted environments (e.g., TEE) and generates verifiable proofs for the development contribution made by specific developers. This talk will introduce the Committable protocol in general with a specific focus on the software monetisation process enabled by trusted software analysis and further highlight the potential of Committable to achieve sustainability for the open-source ecosystem."

Further information about the workshop can be found at the workshop website: https://www.acsac.org/2022/workshops/pavetrust/
