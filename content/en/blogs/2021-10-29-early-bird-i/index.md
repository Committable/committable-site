We plan to launch the Early-Bird Commit Program for the Committable platform. DApp developers can explore this exciting decentralized open-source world via creating and trading their own CMT tokens.

What early birds can get:

- Early access to the Committable platform

- Sponsorship from the Committable team to cover the cost in minting CMTs

- Get your project under spotlights in Committable meetups and online events

The first wave will start from 1, November 2021 to 31, December 2021. Contact us ([support@committable.io](mailto:support@committable.io)) if you are interested in this program and partnership opportunities.
