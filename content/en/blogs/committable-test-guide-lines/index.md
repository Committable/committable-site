## Introduction

Committable is a decentralized protocol for software and developers of open source projects. Committable functions based on an automated **PSR** (Problem Solved, Solution Provided, Risk Introduced) algorithm to enable trustworthy and verifiable computation and abstract analysis of open source data, and return software developers the true ownership of their data through a fair and transparent payroll.

In just a few simple steps, you can start minting and creating payroll on Committable.io

### Test 1: Mint a COMMT (native NFTs on Committable)

#### Step 1:  Connect your Github account and wallet via Metamask

GitHub is a web-based open source development platform and hosting service that allows registered and non-registered users to view, download, and contribute to uploaded files and source code repositories. MetaMask is a cryptoassest wallet and browser plugin that you can download through the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/). Before you start, please make sure MetaMask is installed on your device.

#### Step 2: Once you are connected, click [Mint Commit] to explore your code repository

#### Step 3: Select your codes, then [Mint] with one click

You can use the checkboxes to select multiple Commits, or click the “Mint” button directly after a Commit to Mint

Please wait patiently for the COMMIT casting, which is a native NFT of the Committable website and includes your commit code, an analysis report of the meta-commit code, and an artistic image generated from the code parameters

#### Step 4: View your COMMIT

You can view the COMMIT list from your Github account list under Minted COMMITs, or from the Mint COMMT button to view the COMMIT list for the corresponding project.

### Meta-Commit data

To view the trusted computing report, simply click [Raw Data], where you can find PSR algo analyzed **Abstract Syntax Graph, Control Flow Graph, and Dependency Graph.**![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4-1024x518.png)![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5-1024x516.png)![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1024x520.png)

### Test 2: Payroll

Once the CMT tokens are minted, creating and distributing payroll on Committable is simply a one-click operation, **easy like lemon squeeze.**

#### Step 1: Create a payroll

![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic10-1024x579.png)

Fill in the link to a project on github

![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic11-1024x950.png)


#### Step 2: Fill in payroll infomation

Enter Payroll name, amount, transaction duration, protocol and contract address.

- **Note that default erc20 tokens are used for testing in Committable.io Payroll scenario.**
- **You can click [Import a contract address] to manually enter the testnet protocol address.**

> Example uses USTD-M, address（0xD2856Dfc2948711B1659FaaBcb200e0717470E2A）Collection USTD-M method: Transfer 0 eth to this address
>
> - Please go to https://rinkebyfaucet.com/ to get test rinkeby eth，you could get 0.5 rinkeby eth

##### **Payroll-step 2**

Targeted incentives, combined with the PSR assessment model, can set three modes of targeted incentives.

1. **Commits-Based**: set this incentive in order to reward specific code, and code within a set range can receive the incentive.![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic11-2-1024x653.png)

 

2. **Issue-Based**: in order to encourage the development of specific requirements, or to reward the development of specific requirements, set this incentive, and the code associated with this requirement can receive a targeted incentive.

3. **Time-Period-Based**: code developed within a set time period can receive this targeted incentive. You can choose a past time, a present or future time period for the incentive, e.g. incentivise the development of new features for August 2022, as long as the Commits generated within this time period are covered by the incentive.![img](https://committable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic11-4-1024x489.png)

#### Step 3: Payroll is created successfully and awaits the casting of COMMITs from eligible developers or the casting of eligible COMMITs into Payroll
