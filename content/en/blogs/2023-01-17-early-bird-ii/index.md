Committable Early Bird Program — January 16th, 2023

> POAP is an acronym for “Proof of Attendance [and participation] Protocol”, while an NFT is a unique digital collectible. A POAP NFT is a specific type of NFT that shows one have attended an event or experience. — Lily Daly

Access our early bird program via the link and receive your rewards from February 27th, 2023: [**https://app-test.committable.io**.](https://app-test.committable.io./)

Our Early Bird Program allows developers worldwide to fully experience the Committable protocol on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.

**For participating developers:**

Committable requires developers to immerse into the protocol’s basic functionality through either one of three specific tasks, which are minting, sponsoring, and trading, allowing them to choose to experience various ecosystem stakeholder’s role. Developers who take advantage of the exclusive Early Bird Program launch will be able to receive one to three of their own Committable NFT, which they can manage as they see fit.

**For participating projects:**

Committable invites projects to participate in the early bird program by involving as many developers as possible and earning a corresponding bonus reward (see section 4 for more information).

**2. How it Works**

We welcome all interested developers to participate in our Early Bird Program. After you’ve entered Commitable’s web application (https://app-test.committable.io), you’ll be able to complete one to three independent tasks — which requires you to engage with the Committable’s Protocol — in order to become eligible to claim your own Committable POAP NFT.

All participants must first **login** into Committable’s application using GitHub as a third-party platform (walkthrough demo video below 0:05s — 0:10s).

- The **minting** task requires you to mint at least ONE software NFT asset, also known as COMMIT, from a **public GitHub project** that you have been contributing and committed to — the COMMIT generated will reflect your contribution at the time, as well as generate your digital identity that you will be able to manage moving forward if you choose so (walkthrough demo video below 0:11s — 0:37s).
- The **sponsoring** task requires you to donate at least ONE time to any given pull request, for a project of your liking, which you aim to support and help grow into the open-source ecosystem (walkthrough demo video below 0:38s — 1:06s).
- The **trading** task requires you to buy or sell at least one COMMIT via OpenSea or GitAsset’s marketplace (walkthrough demo video below 1:07s — 1:26s). Becoming a COMMIT seller provides you a potential financial reward, while becoming a COMMIT buyer grants you ownership of contributions made to a specific project.

**Walkthrough demo video:**

Follow the steps as demonstrated in the video (also accessible on committable.io homepage) to complete the early bird tasks.

**3. Rewards for participating developers**

Participating in either of the three above mentioned tasks will allow you to become part of an innovative, disruptive, and trendy community.

Developers will be rewarded with **one Committable POAP NFT** for each task completed, meaning each developer will receive one reward per task at most, totaling a maximum of three rewards for this early bird program.

Of the 500 available POAP NFTs, 250 will be Developer Reward POAP NFTs for the minting task (left below image), 100 will be Sponsor Reward POAP NFTs for the sponsoring task (center below image) and 100 will be Trader Reward POAP NFTs for the trading task (right below image).

**4. Bonus Rewards for participating projects**

As a thank you to Committable’s early contributors, we offer a **bonus Committable POAP NFT**, for projects who have successfully invited their developers to join the Early Bird Program. Qualified early contributors include Committable’s team members, advisors, contributors, investors, project leaders and related.

We encourage relevant contributors, to contact us directly to pre-register their projects as part of the bonus reward early bird program, or to register throughout the early bird program period. Each COMMIT must be minted by a different developer to be counted towards the bonus award, and the project will be rewarded according to the number of minting tasks completed — *N.B.: a developer minting more than one minting task will be counted as one for the bonus reward.*

Three tiers of Committable POAP NFT rewards have been designed as follows:

- **Bonus Reward Level 1** consists of projects with 10 or more participating developers — *therefore 10 or more individually minted COMMITs minted from 10 or more developers* — with the corresponding gold Committable POAP NFT reward define as excellent achievement.
- **Bonus Reward Level 2** consists of projects with 4 to 9 participating developers— *therefore 4 to 9 individually minted COMMITs minted from 4 to 9 developer*s — with the corresponding silver Committable POAP NFT reward define as very good achievment.
- **Bonus Reward Level 3** consists of project with 2 to 3 participating developers — *therefore 2 to 3 individually minted COMMITs minted from 2 to 3 developers* — with the corresponding bronze Committable POAP NFT reward define as good achievement.

Gold Reward for Bonus Level 1  | Silver Reward for Bonus Level 2 | Bronze Reward for Bonus Level 3

**5. Early Bird Program Launch Date**

The Early Bird Program will be launched in conjunction with Committable Protocol Ethereum testnet new version release — with UI design upgrades as well as the minting process upgrade — on Monday January 16th, 2023, at 00:00 Eastern Central Time. Developers will be able to access the early bird program via Committable’s early bird application link (https://app-test.committable.io), until February 20th, 2023.

**6. Disclaimer**

1. The Early Bird Program is open to all developers worldwide. It is important for developers to carefully follow the local laws and regulations of their region when participating in the Early Bird Program.
2. Although the Early Bird Program will be open for five weeks, as the rewarding Committable POAP NFTs are capped at 500 (maximum amount available during the program), only the first 500 participating will receive the distributed rewards.
