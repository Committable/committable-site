# What is CMT?

CMT is the native non-fungible token (NFT) on Committable, minted out of a commit in an open-source software project.

Every CMT is unique in a way that systematically reflects the development contribution of a developer.
CMT is much more than a hash of a commit. It tokenizes a commit with a 3-dimensional package including:

- **Commit**: a Reference to the original commit record
- **Meta-Commit**:a Meta-Commit that yields fundamental knowledge and value of the commit via trusted software analysis
- **Autograph via generative art**:an Autograph of the commit based on generative art of software

CMT is a tradable asset with a computational proof of both participation and innovation in the open-source ecosystem.
